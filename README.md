Introduction
Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It provides good defaults for store setup, simplifies the most common use cases, and includes useful utilities to create efficient Redux applications.

Vite is a fast build tool that leverages native ES modules and provides a smooth development experience with instant hot module replacement (HMR).

Course Overview
In this course, you will learn:

Setting up a Redux Toolkit project with Vite
Creating slices and reducers
Using the Redux Toolkit createSlice function
Managing asynchronous operations with createAsyncThunk
Configuring the Redux store
Best practices for organizing Redux code
Integrating Redux with React components
Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/redux-toolkit-course.git
cd redux-toolkit-course
npm install

public/: Static assets.
src/: Source code.
app/: Redux store configuration.
features/: Redux slices and related components.
components/: Reusable UI components.
App.js: Main application component.
index.js: Entry point for the React application.
index.css: Global styles.

Getting Started
To start the development server, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start Vite in development mode with hot module replacement enabled. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Redux Toolkit Concepts
In this course, you will learn about the following Redux Toolkit concepts:

createSlice: A function that accepts an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a slice name, and automatically generates action creators and action types.
configureStore: A function that wraps around the Redux createStore function, and simplifies store configuration by setting up good defaults.
createAsyncThunk: A function that handles asynchronous logic by generating action creators for pending, fulfilled, and rejected states.
Example Code
Here's a simple example of how to create a counter slice:

js
Copy code
// src/features/counter/counterSlice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: {
    value: 0,
  },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

export default counterSlice.reducer;
Running the Project
To build the project for production, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will generate the production-ready files in the dist directory.

To preview the production build, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run preview
